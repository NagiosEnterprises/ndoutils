#####################################################################



# LOCK FILE
# This is the lockfile that NDO2DB will use to store its PID number
# in when it is running in daemon mode.

lock_file=@piddir@/ndo2db.pid



# USER/GROUP PRIVILEGES
# These options determine the user/group that the daemon should run as.
# You can specify a number (uid/gid) or a name for either option.

ndo2db_user=@ndo2db_user@
ndo2db_group=@ndo2db_group@



# SOCKET TYPE
# This option determines what type of socket the daemon will create
# an accept connections from.
# Value:
#   unix = Unix domain socket (default)
#   tcp  = TCP socket

socket_type=unix
#socket_type=tcp



# SOCKET NAME
# This option determines the name and path of the UNIX domain 
# socket that the daemon will create and accept connections from.
# This option is only valid if the socket type specified above
# is "unix".

socket_name=@localstatedir@/ndo.sock



# TCP PORT
# This option determines what port the daemon will listen for
# connections on.  This option is only vlaid if the socket type
# specified above is "tcp".

tcp_port=@ndo2db_port@



# ENCRYPTION
# This option determines if the ndo2db daemon will accept SSL to encrypt the 
# network traffic between module and ndo2db daemon.
# Both sides have to enable this feature which depends on SSL Libraries
# like openssl or kerberos 
# This option is only valid if the output type
# option specified above is "tcpsocket".
#
# A value of '1' will enable this feature

use_ssl=0



# DATABASE SERVER TYPE
# This option determines what type of DB server the daemon should connect to.
# Values:
#   mysql = MySQL

db_servertype=mysql



# DATABASE HOST
# This option specifies what host the DB server is running on.

db_host=localhost



# DATABASE PORT
# This option specifies the port that the DB server is running on.
# Values:
#  3306 = Default MySQL port

db_port=3306



# DATABASE SOCKET
# This option specifies the path to the socket to use for local DB connections.
#
# MySQL's default location is /tmp/mysql.sock, but /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
# is common for RPM distributions, and /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock is seen on
# Ubuntu...
#
# You normally do not need to set this option unless you experience connection
# problems with messages in NDO2DB's log like:
#   "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket ..."

#db_socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock



# DATABASE NAME
# This option specifies the name of the database that should be used.

db_name=nagios



# DATABASE TABLE PREFIX
# Determines the prefix (if any) that should be prepended to table names.
# If you modify the table prefix, you'll need to modify the SQL script for
# creating the database!

db_prefix=nagios_



# DATABASE USERNAME/PASSWORD
# This is the username/password that will be used to authenticate to the DB.
# The user needs at least SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges on
# the database.

db_user=ndouser
db_pass=ndopassword



## TABLE TRIMMING OPTIONS
# Several database tables containing Nagios event data can become quite large
# over time.  Most admins will want to trim these tables and keep only a
# certain amount of data in them.  The options below are used to specify the
# age (in MINUTES) that data should be allowd to remain in various tables
# before it is deleted.  Using a value of zero (0) for any value means that
# that particular table should NOT be automatically trimmed.

# Keep timed events for 24 hours
max_timedevents_age=1440

# Keep system commands for 1 week
max_systemcommands_age=10080

# Keep service checks for 1 week
max_servicechecks_age=10080

# Keep host checks for 1 week
max_hostchecks_age=10080

# Keep event handlers for 31 days
max_eventhandlers_age=44640

# Keep external commands for 31 days
max_externalcommands_age=44640

# Keep notifications for 31 days
max_notifications_age=44640

# Keep contactnotifications for 31 days
max_contactnotifications_age=44640

# Keep contactnotificationmethods for 31 days
max_contactnotificationmethods_age=44640

# Keep logentries for 90 days
max_logentries_age=129600

# Keep acknowledgements for 31 days
max_acknowledgements_age=44640



# DEBUG LEVEL
# This option determines how much (if any) debugging information will
# be written to the debug file.  OR values together to log multiple
# types of information.
# Values: -1 = Everything
#          0 = Nothing
#          1 = Process info
#	   2 = SQL queries

debug_level=0



# DEBUG VERBOSITY
# This option determines how verbose the debug log out will be.
# Values: 0 = Brief output
#         1 = More detailed
#         2 = Very detailed

debug_verbosity=1



# DEBUG FILE
# This option determines where the daemon should write debugging information.

debug_file=@localstatedir@/ndo2db.debug



# MAX DEBUG FILE SIZE
# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the debug file.  If
# the file grows larger than this size, it will be renamed with a .old
# extension.  If a file already exists with a .old extension it will
# automatically be deleted.  This helps ensure your disk space usage doesn't
# get out of control when debugging.

max_debug_file_size=1000000


# MAX OUTPUT BUFFER SIZE
# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the output buffer. 
# NDO2DB will start truncating characters after this value.
# If you have very large long output and you're not seeing it all in the database,
# try increasing this number.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The 'long_output' fields in the database are set to TEXT fields, and the maximum
# size of a TEXT field is 64KB, so if you really want to make use of this field, you'll need to set
# the long_output fields to MEDIUMTEXT OR LONGTEXT.
# the long_output column exists in the following tables:
#  _eventhandlers, _hostchecks, _hoststatus, _notifications, _servicechecks, _servicestatus, _statehistory, _systemcommands
# An example sql alter statement might look like this:
# ALTER TABLE nagios_hoststatus MODIFY COLUMN long_output LONGTEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
max_output_buffer_size=65536
